LET->CONSTANT VAR->VARIABLE
LET VARIABLES CAN BE DECLARED WITHOUT A VALUE BUT THEY CAN
GET ASSIGNED ONLY ONCE.
THERE IS A IMPLICIT TYPE INFERENCE WHEN ASSIGNING BUT THERE
COULD BE THE NEED OF AN EXPLICIT ONE WITH let explDouble: Double = 70
NO IMPLICIT CONVERSION ARE MADE, ONLY EXPLICIT.
TO INCLUDE VALUES IN STRING ALSO \(value).
DICTIONARIES WITH [] AND PROPERTIES INSIDE LIKE JAVASCRIPT
ARRAYS GROW AUTOMATICALLY
WHEN CREATING AN EMPTY ARRAY TYPE CAN BE INFERED THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING
IS INSERTED OR SETTED.
